# Set up

Potential packages are first loaded to use for our problem sets. Figure
preferences were used to set figure sizing and aesthetics for plotting
outputs.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(rvest)
library(scales)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

# Problem 1

Problem set 1 outlines the function to be used to estimate the
probability of sharing a birthday in a calendar year for a group size of
2:50. A figure was plotted to observe these estimates using `ggplot`.

``` r
bday_prob = function(n) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(n) || length(n) != 1 || n < 1) {
    
    stop("n must be a single positive number") 
    
    }

  bday_samp = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  any(duplicated(bday_samp))
  
}
```

``` r
set.seed(1)

bday_results =
  tibble(
    n = 2:50,
    bday_probability = map_dbl(
      n, \(x) mean(replicate(10000, bday_prob(x)
                             )
                   )
      )
  )

bday_results
```

    ## # A tibble: 49 × 2
    ##        n bday_probability
    ##    <int>            <dbl>
    ##  1     2           0.0024
    ##  2     3           0.0085
    ##  3     4           0.0167
    ##  4     5           0.0267
    ##  5     6           0.0399
    ##  6     7           0.0521
    ##  7     8           0.0751
    ##  8     9           0.0925
    ##  9    10           0.116 
    ## 10    11           0.139 
    ## # ℹ 39 more rows

``` r
bday_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = bday_probability)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 1. Probability of Shared Birthday by Group Size",
    x = "Group size",
    y = "Probability of shared birthday"
  )
```

Figure 1 shows that the probability of sharing a birthday increases as
the group size increases. For example, in a random group of 23 people,
there is a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday.
We see that the probability of shared birthdays among two people
increases closer to 100% with at least 40 people in a random sample.
This is because we’re making comparisons based on matches, so the rate
of possible shared birthdays increases at a faster rate than the group
size
